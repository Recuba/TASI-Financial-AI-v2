================================================================================
DATA QUALITY NOTES
================================================================================

1. Some companies have null values for "total_equity" - this may indicate they
   use different XBRL taxonomy or report equity differently

2. Some values appear very large (in billions) because they're already in
   absolute SAR rather than thousands - check reporting_unit field

3. Negative net_income values indicate losses for that fiscal year

4. Investment income includes both insurance operations investment gains and
   shareholder operations commission/profit on deposits where available

================================================================================
USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. This data is for RESEARCH ONLY - verify critical figures before use

2. When comparing companies, ensure you're using the same fiscal year

3. Note that this is NOT 2024 data - it's the latest available (mostly 2022)

4. Before inserting into database, consider normalizing all values to the
   same reporting unit (either SAR or thousands SAR)

5. For companies with missing data, consider manually reviewing the Excel
   files or seeking alternative data sources
